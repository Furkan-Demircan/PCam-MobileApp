```text
Searching for devices...
```

4. Press the broadcast button in the Android application.

---

## 🎭 Using PCam in Zoom, Discord & Teams

### Install OBS Studio

Install OBS Studio if it is not already installed.

OBS provides the required Virtual Camera driver.

### Start PCam

1. Connect your phone.
2. Verify that the preview is visible.

### Enable Virtual Camera Output

Enable:

```text
Send to Virtual Camera
```

from the settings panel.

### Select OBS Virtual Camera

Inside your video conferencing software:

1. Open Video Settings.
2. Select:

```text
OBS Virtual Camera
```

Your smartphone feed is now available as a webcam.

---

## ⚙️ Troubleshooting

### Green Screen or Corrupted Pixels

In unstable wireless environments, the initial H.264 keyframe may arrive fragmented.

If the preview appears green or heavily pixelated:

1. Click **Switch Camera** once.
2. The mobile encoder will generate a fresh keyframe.
3. The stream should immediately recover.

---

### Temporary Disconnect Messages

PCam includes an intelligent timeout threshold of **4 seconds**.

Short packet loss events will not immediately terminate the stream.

For maximum stability, use USB mode.

---

### Windows Defender SmartScreen Warning

Because PCam is distributed as a standalone executable generated using PyInstaller and does not currently include a commercial code-signing certificate, Windows may display:

```text
Windows protected your PC
```

This is a common false positive for independent software distributions.

PCam:

* Is open source
* Contains no malware
* Does not install background services
* Cleans up all spawned processes on exit

---

## 👨‍💻 Local Development

### Requirements

* Python 3.10+
* FFmpeg
* Android SDK Platform Tools (optional)

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install pillow opencv-python numpy zeroconf pyvirtualcam
```

### Run Desktop Client

```bash
python PCam-MobileApp.py
```

---

## 📦 Building a Release

Install PyInstaller:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

Generate a standalone executable:

```bash
pyinstaller PCam-MobileApp.spec --clean
```

---

## 💡 Architecture Notes

PCam was designed with resource efficiency in mind.

Core design principles:

* Asynchronous networking
* Hardware-accelerated video encoding
* Minimal memory allocations
* Lightweight desktop UI
* Event-driven architecture

This allows PCam to deliver low-latency video streaming while maintaining low CPU and memory usage on both desktop and mobile devices.
